Welcome to the workflow section! Everything I use (and perhaps more!) should be linked here, with any luck.

# TUI Apps / Tools
 * [Bacon](https://github.com/Canop/bacon)
 * [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix)
 * [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot)
 * [Yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi)
 * [Zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij)

(You'll likely have noticed that these are all built in Rust. Yes, I am an avid Rust enjoyer. No, I'm not sorry.)

# Operating System
Currently, I'm running Ubuntu 25.04, running KDE Plasma 6.3.4 on Wayland.

I'm thinking about changing this at some point in the future -- possibly to something like [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), though KDE's [new distribution](https://kde.org/linux/) is certainly in the running!

## Themes

As I'm running KDE, I suppose it's a given I'm using some themes. Here they are, in order of the categories in the "Colours & Themes" window:

* Global Theme: Breeze Dark
* Colours: Breeze Dark
* Application Style: MS Windows 9x
* Plasma Style: Breeze*
* Window Decorations: Windows 98
* Icons: Memphis 98
* Cursors: Chicago 95 Standard
* System Sounds: Ocean**
* Login Screen (SDDM): Reactionary KDE1
* Boot Screen: Breeze (Text Mode)


\* - todo!("I'd like to modify Reactionary into a dark mode variant. I like its aesthetic, but it's [too bright](https://tenor.com/view/deltarune-pumpkin-crying-jackenstein-your-taking-too-long-gif-10931211469293787300)");
\** - I actually modified a few of these manually into what is I believe the Windows XP sounds. Don't super remember though, set it up a while ago..
